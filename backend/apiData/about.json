It focuses on programs, services and leadership opportunities for youth and young adults, ages 16-25 in Wyoming, including services for health and mental healthcare, housing, education, and more. The Map began as a way to connect youth with mental health services, and has expanded to include anything that may improve quality of life for youth and young adults. \n The Casper Youth Hub Resource Map is funded and contributed to by SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration) and local service providers.",
