If we do not answer immediately, please leave a message with your name and a safe way for us to reach you. If you are not using a VP, you will automatically connect to a Video Relay Services (VRS) interpreter, who will interpret the call free of charge. You may also reach us via email but please keep in mind the VP number is usually the fastest way to contact DOVE. \n\n(Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing approved.)",

We also offer mental health services (individual, group and family therapy), provided by our very own LGBTQIA2S+ licensed therapist. OHP and private insurance accepted (applies to therapy only - no charge for accessing any of Bravery's other social support/resource services.) Bravery can also help connect youth to local/regional resources, such as affirming healthcare providers, financial assistance for gender-affirming items, and more. In the near future, Bravery hopes to open a physical drop-in space with loads more resources, so stay tuned!\n\nLast, but not least, Bravery has a growing youth leadership team that provides youth with the opportunity to become more involved in their community, learn leadership skills, and take an active role in program development, local advocacy, and more. \n\nTo learn more, you can visit our website or Facebook page, @projectbravery.",

We are either current or former participants of the Early Assessment and Support Alliance (EASA) program in Oregon. EASA is Oregon's public health program for young people experiencing psychosis for the first time.\n\nAt least once a month we get together via Microsoft Teams and work on various projects related to psychosis and mental health awareness/treatment, stigma busting, community service, peer support, and providing lived experience feedback for EASA. Some examples of our projects thus far have been presentations for college psychology classes and the mental health workforce, sharing our story of recovery and hope via podcasts, advocating on state government councils, attending and presenting at mental health conferences, and providing resource information in our communities. We get paid for our hard work as well, which is pretty cool.\n\nReach out! We have applications ready and are always open to hearing from new folks who are from EASA and are interested in joining.
