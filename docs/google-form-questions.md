## Google Form Setup Notes

1. **Form title**: "Add Your Organization to the Wyoming Resource Map"
2. **Form description**: "Use this form to submit your organization's information to the Wyoming Resource Map. After review, your resource will be added to the map. If you requested admin access, we will reach out to set up your account."
3. Set the form to **collect email addresses** (Google Forms setting) as a backup contact method.
4. Enable **response receipts** so submitters get a copy of what they submitted.
5. Responses will go to a linked Google Sheet for the admin team to review.
6. After review, the admin creates the listing in the admin panel and (optionally) creates an org user account linked to that listing.
